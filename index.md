### Multiclass classification on an unknown data set 

With Sneha Konnur, Ravina Gelda

This project was done as part of the course on Introduction to Machine Learning offered by Dr. Balaraman Ravindran in the fall of 2015. 

##### Objective
Training data corresponding to 100 classes was provided. The task was to perform multi-class classification resulting in the best mean F1-measure for the 100 classes. 

##### Exploratory Data Analysis
We did an initial exploration of the data to understand it better. We performed the following experiments in this regard:

- Obtained the class counts
    - The 68th class occurs a good 1000 times in the data. The other classes occur on an average
      around 133 times. This is a clear case of data imbalance. 
      
- Sparsity
    - The data at hand is sparse. The attributes have zeros in the range 7000-12000. Few of the
      attributes clearly look like noise with data points in as few as 6 out of 14332 rows.
